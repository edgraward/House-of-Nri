    <h3>Inspired by Culture, Crafted with Passion</h3>
    <p>
      Named after the ancient Igbo kingdom known for its wisdom and hospitality, House of Nri brings you the very soul of Nigerian cuisine. 
      We believe that food is not just nourishment — it’s heritage. 
      Our recipes are passed down, our spices are homemade, and our flavors are unapologetically bold.
    </p>

    <p>
      From bustling Lagos to peaceful villages, we bring you meals that reflect the warmth, color, and joy of Nigeria. 
      Whether you're savoring a spoonful of egusi or the smoky aroma of party jollof, you're experiencing a legacy of love.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our mission is simple: to share our culture through unforgettable dishes — delivered hot, fresh, and with pride.
